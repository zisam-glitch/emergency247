                    Try over the counter painkillers like paracetamol or
                    ibuprofen. Only take the medications if you are normally ok
                    taking them. Occasionally it will reduce the pain slightly
                    until you can get to the dentist. This is only a temporary
                    measure but sometimes it helps if you have no other
                    alternative.

                    Hot salt water mouth washes are very useful if you have a
                    swelling or some sort of infection. Salt water is a natural
                    anti septic and can reduce pain.

                    Why is tooth ache worse at night time?

                <AccordionContent id="eliven">
                    Many people suffer with dental pain at night time. A lot of
                    the time the pain makes it unbearable to sleep. A lot of
                    pain at night time is due to the position of you lying down,
                    blood rushing to the head and the pain or swelling inside
                    the tooth increase.
                    <br />
                    Before getting to this level of pain we always advise a
                    visit to the dentist so to avoid such dilemmas. The dentist
                    will take x rays and check which tooth is causing the pain.
                    So many times the pain spreads top and bottom unable to
                    locate the pain. Thus the x ray is one of the best tests to
                    elicit where the pain is coming from.

                    How to get emergency dental treatment on the NHS?

                <AccordionContent id="thirteen">
                    If you are registered with an NHS dentist you may be able to
                    get a dentist appointment at your own dentist, however it
                    may not be on the same day. Dental practices generally close
                    at 5 pm so to get an NHS emergency dentist appointment may
                    be difficult.
                    <br />
                    Out of hours NHS do provide emergency appointments but have
                    very strict criteria such as persistent bleeding and unable
                    to breathe or swallow due to swelling.
                    <br />
                    If this is the case your NHS dentist should have an
                    alternate local number for you to call in the case of
                    emergency.
